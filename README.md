##  Description

This project simulates an ATM system with functionalities similar to real-world ATMs. The system uses a file-based storage mechanism (`accounts.dat`) to persist user accounts and balances. It ensures user-friendly interactivity, validation checks, and secure access via PIN.

---

##  Features

- Create a new account with automatic Account Number and PIN generation.
- Login using only a **4-digit PIN**.
- Check account balance.
- Deposit money.
- Withdraw money (with minimum balance check).
- Clear input fields and Exit buttons.
- All data is saved to a file to preserve user accounts.

---

## How to Use

###  Login

- Enter your 4-digit PIN to access your account.
- Click **Login**.

###  Create Account

- Click **Create Account** on the login screen.
- Enter:
  - Your **Name**
  - **Initial Deposit** (must be ≥ 100)
- The system generates:
  - A random **Account Number**
  - A secure **4-digit PIN**
- Save your PIN for future logins.

###  ATM Operations

- **View Balance**: Check your current balance.
- **Deposit**: Add funds (amount must be positive).
- **Withdraw**: Withdraw funds (minimum balance of 100 must remain).
- **Logout**: Return to the login screen.
-  **Data Persistence:** Account details saved locally in `accounts.dat`.
-  **Interactive GUI:** Built using Java Swing with clear, exit, and error handling.
